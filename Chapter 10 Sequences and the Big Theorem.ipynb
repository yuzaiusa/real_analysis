    "A sequence  is increasing if , and it is decreasing if . A sequence is monotone if it is either increasing or decreasing. If the relationship in this definition is strict, it is called strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. If this relationship only holds after a certain index k, it is called eventually increasing or eventually decreasing.\n",

    "Let . Then it can be shown by induction that , or  is an upper bound of . Apparently,  converges to 2, but this does not mean that  is 2 because 2 is only an upper bound rather than a supremum. There is no indication that the gap between  and  is shrinking to zero.\n",

    "This is actually the famous Basel problem which was solved by young Euler. It is also a special case of the Riemann zeta function at 2. The correct limit is .\n",
