    "## DEFINITION 10.1 (Monotonous sequences):\n",
    "A sequence $(x_n)$ is **increasing** if $x_{n+1}\\ge x_n, \\forall n\\in N$, and it is **decreasing** if $x_{n+1}\\le x_n, \\forall n\\in N$. A sequence is **monotone** if it is either increasing or decreasing. If the relationship in this definition is strict, it is called **strictly increasing** or **strictly decreasing**. If this relationship only holds after a certain index $k$, it is called **eventually increasing** or **eventually decreasing**.\n",

    "If $(x_n)$ is **increasing** and **bounded**, then $\\lim x_n=\\sup\\{x_n\\}$. If $(x_n)$ is **decreasing** and **bounded**, then $\\lim x_n = \\inf \\{x_n\\}$.\n",

    "Let $$s_n = 1 + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + ... + \\frac{1}{n^2}.$$ Then it can be shown by induction that $$s_n < 2 -\\frac{1}{n} \\text{, for }n=2,3,...,$$ or $2-\\frac{1}{n}$ is an upper bound of $s_n$. Apparently, $2-\\frac{1}{n}$ converges to 2, but this does not mean that $\\lim s_n$ is 2 because 2 is only an upper bound rather than a **supremum**. There is no indication that the gap between $2-\\frac{1}{n}$ and $s_n$ is shrinking to zero.\n",

The result from **Exercise 10.3.8** is consistent with this formula in the sense: $$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n^2-a}{2x_n} = \\frac{x_n^2 -a}{2x_n} = \\frac{1}{2}(x_n-\\frac{a}{x_n})$$.\n",

Above continued fraction can be defined as $[2,2,2,...]$. Another example is the golden ratio, which is $$[1,1,1,...] = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}.$$\n",
