    "(1) Open intervals are open. The whole real line is open.\n",

    "THEOREM 8.4 (Intersection of finite collection of open sets):\n",
    "The intersection of any finite collection of open sets is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the difference between THEOREM 8.3 and THEOREM 8.4. The union allows infinitely many open sets but the intersection has to be a finite collection. Exercise 8.1.4 is the counter example if we do infinitely many intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare THEOREM 8.3 and THEOREM 8.4 to THEOREM 8.8 and THEOREM 8.9, there are an interesting mirror image between the properties of open sets and closed sets.\n",

    "(ii) The union of any collection of sets from  is in . and \n",
    "(iii) The intersection of any finite collection of sets from  is in . \n",
    "Then is called a topology on X. The pair  is called a topological space, and the elements of  are called open subsets of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that union is ANY union while intersection is FINITE intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that, it doesn't require complement of a set to be in the topology. In fact, the complement of an open set is a closed set which should not be in the topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition draws some analogue to the definition of sigma-algebra. In sigma algebra, it requires closed under countable unions and complements.\n",
    "\n",
    "An open set in one topology might not be open in another topology over the same universal set X. If we talk about open set/interval, we should be specific which topogoly we are talking about. Real anlysis concerns about the Euclidean topology. But that is not the only topology over the real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A proof or definition that is topological, that is, one that uses only facts about open sets, is usually preferable to one that uses other structures (such as order, algebra, or distance).\n",

    "(e)/(g) If X is any set,  is topology on X, which is called the finite complement topology.\n",

    "Exercise 8.2.2 (Dense Sets):\n",
    "(a) A set is dense in the real line if its intersection with any open set is nonempty.\n",

    "THEOREM 8.6 (Closed Sets):\n",
    "A set is closed if it contains all its cluster points, that is .\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 8.3:\n",
    "(1) Closed intervals and the whole real line are closed sets.\n",
    "(2) The empty set is closed since it has no cluster points.\n",

    "A nonempty, closed and bounded set contains its supremum and infimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "The converse of this is not true. THEOREM 5.3 implies that an open interval cannot contains its supremum or infimum. But it could be the case that the set contains an open interval which makes the set neither open nor closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 8.3.2 (Closure, Interior and Boundary):\n",
    "The closure of a set S, denoted , is the intersection of all closed sets containing S. The interior of S, denoted , is the union of all open sets contained in S. The boundary of S, denoted , is .\n",

    "Exercise 8.3.5 (Kuratowski’s Problem):\n",
    "(b) Construct a set, take the closure of the set, then the complement of its closure, and the closure of the complement of its closure. Repeat this over and over: closure -> complement -> closure -> … The question is how many different sets can we obtain in this way. This is called Kuratowski’s problem, and the answer is 14. A subset realizing the maximum of 14 is called a 14-set. The space of real numbers under the usual topology contains 14-sets.\n",

    "THEOREM 8.11 (Structure of Open Sets): \n",
    "A nonempty set S is open if and only if there is a countable collection of mutually disjoint open intervals  such that .\n",

    "Exercise 8.4.3 (Open Sets a countable union of closed sets):\n",
    "(a) Any open interval is a countable union of closed intervals (not necessarily disjoint).\n",
    "(b) Any open set is a countable union of closed intervals.\n",

    "For each point x in the topological space, there is a countable collection of open sets , each containing x and such that if U is any open set containing x, there is an n so that . The collection is called a local neighborhood base at x. Notice that the collection  probably changes from point to point. \n",
    "A topology is called second countable if \n",
    "there is a single countable collection  such that, if x is in the space and U is an open set containing x, then there is an n so that . Such a collection  is called a base (or basis) for the topology. Note that a basis need not be countable.\n",

    "(b) The standard topology on the real line is second countable.\n",
    "(c) Any second countable topology is also first countable.\n",
    "(f) Cofinite topology is an example of a topology that is not first countable. Any uncountable discrete space is first countable but not second countable.\n",
    "(g) If  is a basis for a topology , then every element of  can be written as a union of sets in .\n",
    "(h) If  is a topological space and  is a collection of subsets of X with the property that every element in  can be written as a union of sets, each of which is the intersection of finitely many of the sets in .  is called a subbasis for . The collection of open rays is a subbasis for the standard topology on the real line. \n",

    "(d) The length of C is therefore 0.\n",
    "(e) C consists of all elements of  whose ternary expansion contains no 1s.\n",
    "(f) C is uncountable. Therefore C is an example whose cardinality is as high as  but whose length is 0. The connection between cardinality and length is mystery.\n",
    "(g) The end points of C is countable. So, there are non-end-point elements in C. An example would be 1/4.\n",
    "(i) A fat Cantor set (or Smith-Volterra-Cantor set) can be constructed by removing 1/4 instead of 1/3. This fat Cantor set has a non-trivial length of 1/2. More interestingly, the set is still uncountable and not dense in any place. This is a very intriguing example. By construction, the fat Cantor set contains no intervals and therefore has empty interior. It is also the intersection of a sequence of closed sets, which means that it is closed. However, the part removed only has a positive Lebesgue measure of 1/2. This makes the fat Cantor set an example of a closed set whose boundary has positive Lebesgue measure of 1-1/2=1/2.\n",
    "(j) There is a one-to-one correspondence between C and  by converting the ternary expansion to binary expansion, which is why C is uncountable.\n",
