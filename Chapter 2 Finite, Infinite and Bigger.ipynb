    "## DEFINITION 2.1 (One-to-one Correspondence, Finite and Infinite Sets)\n",
    "+ (a) A function c : S → T is a **one-to-one correspondence** if it has the following properties: \n",
    "    + (i) $\\forall x \\in S, \\forall y \\in S, (x\\neq y \\Rightarrow c(x) \\neq c(y))$, that is, c is **one-to-one**, and \n",
    "    + (ii) $\\forall z \\in T, \\exists x \\in S \\ni (c(x) = z)$, that is, c is **onto**. \n",
    "+ (b) If a one-to-one correspondence exists between two sets, we say that the **sets are (or can be put) in one-to-one correspondence**. \n",
    "+ (c) A set is **finite** (and contains n elements) if it can be put in one-to-one correspondence with an **initial segment of natural numbers {1, 2, … n}**. \n",
    "+ (d) A set that is not finite is **infinite**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we take **natural numbers** as something that are intuitive and defined like an **axiom**. This is actually a **circular definition** given the light of **Definition 2.3**. A preferred way of defining a **finite set** is in **Exercise 2.3.7 (c)** and **Exercise 2.1.4 (e)** below, then use **Definition 2.3** to define natural numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DEFINITION 2.2 (Comparing Cardinality): \n",
    "+ (a) Two sets have the **same cardinality** if they can be put in one-to-one correspondence with each other.\n",
    "+ (b) If such sets are finite, we say they have the **same number of elements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DEFINITION 2.3 (Finite Cardinality and Natural Numbers): \n",
    "+ (a) A **cardinality** is **the property common to a collection of sets that can be put in one-to-one correspondence with each other**, but that is not shared by any set that can't be put in one-to-one correspondence with a set in the collection.\n",
    "+ (b) If the sets in such a collection are finite, the cardinality is also said to be finite. A finite cardinality is called a **natural number**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.1.4 (Alternative Definition of Finite Sets)\n",
    "+ (e) It is impossible to have a one-to-one correspondence between a finite set and one of its **proper subsets**. Sets that have this property are **finite sets**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.1.5 (Equivalence Relation and Equivalence Class)\n",
    "The relation $\\approx$ is called an **equivalence relation** on X if it has the properties: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ (i) (**Reflexivity**) $x \\approx x, \\forall x$\n",
    "+ (ii) (**Symmetry**) $x \\approx y \\Rightarrow y \\approx x$\n",
    "+ (iii) (**Transitivity**) $x \\approx y \\text{ and } y \\approx z \\Rightarrow x \\approx z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, = is an equivalence relationship, but $\\leq$ is not because it failed ii).  is actually a **partial order relation**, which has the **antisymmetry property**: $x \\leq y \\text{ and }y \\leq x\\Rightarrow x = y$. Similarly, $\\subseteq$ is a partial order relation rather than an equivalence relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let $X$ be a set and $\\approx$ an equivalence relation on $X$. For any element $a$ of $X$, let $X_a = \\{x\\in X: x\\approx a\\}$. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ (i) $X_a \\neq \\emptyset \\ \\forall a$\n",
    "+ (ii) $\\text{if }X_a \\cap X_b \\neq \\emptyset, \\text{ then } X_a = X_b$, and\n",
    "+ (iii) $X = \\bigcup_a X_a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set $X_a$ is called the **equivalence class** of $a$. Effectively, an equivalence class \"groups\" all elements that are equivalent to $a$ together to form a set. A collection of subsets $\\{X_a\\}$ of a set $X$ having properties (i), (ii), and (iii) is called a **partition** of X.\n",

    "## THEOREM 2.4 (Infinity of Natural Numbers):\n",
    "The set of all **natural numbers**, $N$, is **infinite**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition (Countable and Uncountable Infinity):\n",
    "We are generally interested in sets with only three types of cardinalities: Natural numbers (the cardinalities of finite sets), the cardinality of $N$ (which is denoted $\\aleph_0$, and those that are bigger. A set with cardinality $\\aleph_0$ is said to be **denumerable**. A set that is finite or denumerable is said to be countable. If a set is not **countable**, it is **uncountable**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## THEOREM 2.5 (Algebra of Countable Cardinality): \n",
    "The **union** of a countable collection of countable sets is countable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.2.1 (Cantor-Bernstein-Dedekind Theorem):\n",
    "In set theory, the **Schröder–Bernstein theorem** (named after Felix Bernstein and Ernst Schröder, also known as **Cantor–Bernstein theorem**, or **Cantor–Schröder–Bernstein** after Georg Cantor who first published it without proof) states that, if there exist **injective functions** $f: A\\rightarrow B$ and $g: B \\rightarrow A$ between the sets A and B, then there exists a **bijective function** $h: A \\rightarrow B$. In terms of the cardinality of the two sets, this means that if $|A| \\leq |B|$ and $|B| \\leq |A|$, then $|A| = |B|$; that is, A and B are **equivalent**. This is a useful feature in the **ordering of cardinal numbers** (the cardinal numbers has the **anti-symmetry property** and therefore **partially ordered** (See **Exercise 2.1.5**) ). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.2.5 (Algebraic Numbers):\n",
    "If a number is a solution to a **polynomial equation with coefficients that are integers**, it is called **algebraic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ (a) All **rational numbers** are algebraic.\n",
    "+ (c) The set of algebraic numbers is **countable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.2.6 (Algebra of $\\aleph_0$):\n",
    "+ (a) $\\aleph_0 + \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$\n",
    "+ (b) $\\aleph_0 + n = \\aleph_0$\n",
    "+ (c) $\\aleph_0 \\times \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$\n",

    "# Uncountable Sets\n",
    "## THEOREM (Cantor Diagonalization):\n",
    "In set theory, **Cantor's diagonal argument**, also called **the diagonalisation argument**, **the diagonal slash argument** or **the diagonal method**, was published in 1891 by Georg Cantor as a mathematical proof that there are infinite sets which cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the infinite set of natural numbers. Such sets are now known as **uncountable sets**, and the size of infinite sets is now treated by **the theory of cardinal numbers** which Cantor began.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagonal argument was not Cantor's first proof of the uncountability of the real numbers; it was actually published much later than his **first proof**, which appeared in 1874. However, it demonstrates a powerful and general technique that has since been used in a wide range of proofs, including the first of **Gödel's incompleteness theorems** and **Turing's answer to the Entscheidungsproblem**. Diagonalization arguments are often also the source of contradictions like **Russell's paradox** and **Richard's paradox**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.3.4 (Power Set):\n",
    "The **power set** of a set $S$, denoted $P(S)$, is the set of all subsets of $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ (c) If $S$ is any set at all, the **cardinality** of $P(S)$ is larger than the cardinality of $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.3.5 (Infinity of Aleph Numbers):\n",
    "+ (a) There are **infinitely many** different **infinite cardinals** (**Aleph numbers**).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.3.7 (Alternative Definition of Infinite Sets):\n",
    "+ (b) Every **infinite set** has a **denumerable subset**. (The proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of this book.)\n",
    "+ (c) Every **infinite set** can be put in **one-to-one correspondence** with a **proper subset of itself** (this is an alternative definition of \"infinite\").\n",
    "+ (d) Forming the union of an infinite set with a finite set does not increase the first set's cardinality. \n",
    "+ (e) Forming the union of an infinite set with a countable set does not increase the first set's cardinality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.3.8 (Transcendental Numbers):\n",
    "Numbers that are not algebraic are **transcendental**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.3.9 (Finite subsets):\n",
    "+ (b) The set of **finite subsets of a denumerable set** is **denumerable**. (This draws an analogue to rational numbers whose digit expansion are terminating or repeating - finite subsets vs real numbers whose digit expansion are in general non-repeating - the power set)."
