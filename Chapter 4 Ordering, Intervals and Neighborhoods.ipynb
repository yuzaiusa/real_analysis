Proofs or constructions using **induction** and **recursion** often use **the axiom of choice** to produce a well-ordered relation that can be treated by transfinite induction. However, if the relation in question is already well-ordered, one can often use transfinite induction without invoking the axiom of choice.\n",

    "But it is clear that a number that can be written as the sum of three prime numbers but can't be written as the sum of two prime numbers must be an odd number.

It turns out that k=11.\n",

The **definition of total order** appeared first historically and is a first-order axiomatization of the ordering ≤ as a binary predicate. Artin and Schreier gave the **definition in terms of positive cone** in 1926, which axiomatizes the sub-collection of nonnegative elements. Although the latter is higher-order, viewing positive cones as maximal prepositive cones provides a larger context in which field orderings are extremal partial orderings.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let $F$ be a field. There is a bijection between the field orderings of $F$ and the positive cones of $F$. Given a field ordering $\\leq$ as in the first definition, the set of elements such that $x\\geq 0$ forms a positive cone of $F$. Conversely, given a positive cone $P$ of $F$ as in the second definition, one can associate a total ordering $\\leq$ on $F$ by setting $x\\leq y$ to mean $y − x \\in P$. This total ordering $\\leq$ satisfies the properties of the first definition.\n",

In some fields, these elements aren't all different (in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, for instance, we have $1 + 1 + 1 = 1$). This theorem tells us that this can't happen in an **ordered field**, and consequently that **every ordered field contains a \"copy\" of $N$**. Note that a field that contains such a copy of $N$ also contains copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Q }$ (due to the closeness to addition and multiplication), and so it makes sense to refer to \"**integers**\" and \"**rational elements**\" in any ordered field.\n",

To prove  cannot be ordered, we just find a pair of non-trivial squares that sum up to zero. **Fermat's little theorem** tells that $x^{p-1}$ is congruent to 1, or $x^p$ is congruent to $x$.

    "The reason by saying “_distributed in this way_” is because **THEOREM 4.13** guarantees that every ordered field contains a copy of natural numbers. So, an ordered field is **Archimedean** or not completely depends on how this copy is distributed.
