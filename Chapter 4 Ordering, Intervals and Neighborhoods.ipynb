    "## DEFINITION 4.1 (Linear Order): \n",
    "An **ordering** on a set is linear if, for **any pair of elements** of the set $(a, b)$ one and only one of the following holds: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ (i) $a<b$;\n",
    "+ (ii) $a=b$; or\n",
    "+ (iii) $b<a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the **trichotomy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4.1.1 (Least Element):\n",
    "If $S$ is a subset of an **ordered set**, a **least element** of $S$ is an element $x$, if there is one, such that (i) $x \\in S$ and (ii) if $y \\in S$ and $y$ is comparable to $x$, then $x \\leq y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to notice that a **linearly ordered set might not have a least element**, thus linearly ordered set are **not** necessarily **well ordered**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4.1.8 (Directed Set):\n",
    "+ (b) A set with an ordering is a **directed set** if $S,T \\in X$, then $\\exists U \\in X$ such that $S < U \\text{ and } Y < U$. Intuitively, this says “S and T may not be _directly_ comparable, but there is something comparable to, and bigger than, both of them”.\n",
    "+ (c) The **power set** $P(X)$ with ordering $\\subseteq$ is a directed set.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ (a) n is among the natural numbers: $m+1$, $m + 1 + 1$, $m + 1 + 1 + 1$, … or \n",
    "+ (b) no function whose **domain** is a set with m elements and whose **range** is a set with n elements is **onto**.\n",

    "# Well-ordering and Induction\n",
    "## DEFINITION 4.3 (Well-ordering): \n",
    "A **linearly ordered set** is said to be **well-ordered** if every nonempty subset of it has a **least element**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AXIOM (Well ordering property of natural numbers):\n",
    "The **natural numbers** are **well-ordered**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the foundation for mathematical induction. **Rational numbers**, on contrary, are **not** well ordered by <.\n",

    "## THEOREM 4.4 (Validity of Induction):\n",
    "Suppose $S\\subseteq N$ is such that\n",
    "\n",
    "+ (i)  $1 \\in S$ and\n",
    "+ (ii) $k \\in S \\Rightarrow k+1 \\in S \\text{ whenever } k \\geq 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $S=N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The proof of this theorem used the **well-ordering property of natural numbers** (through contradiction). Therefore, the **well-ordering property** and the **validity of induction** are **equivalent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## THEOREM 4.5 (Mathematical Induction):\n",
    "Suppose $P(n)$ is an open statement, where $n$ can be any natural number. If \n",
    "\n",
    "+ (i) $P(1)$ is true and \n",
    "+ (ii) $P(k) \\Rightarrow P(k + 1)$ whenever $k \\geq 1$, then $P(n)$ is true for all.\n",

    "# Strong Induction\n",
    "## THEOREM 4.6 (Strong Induction): \n",
    "Induction is equivalent to the following: Let $P(n)$ be an open statement, where $n$ can be any natural number. If \n",
    "\n",
    "+ (i) $P(1)$ is true and \n",
    "+ (ii) $(P(1), ..., \\text{ and }P(k)) \\Rightarrow P(k + 1)$ whenever $k \\geq 1$, then $P(n)$ is true for all.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strong induction** is important not so much as a separate technique of proof (by constructing our propositions carefully, we can avoid using it explicitly), but as a signpost to bigger and better things. If we rephrase strong induction in the language we first used to describe induction itself, it would look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "If $S\\subseteq N$ is such that $1\\in S$ and, for each $n > 1$, $\\{ k: k<n \\} \\subseteq S \\Rightarrow n \\in S$, then $S=N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this statement makes sense with N replaced by any **well-ordered set** and 1 replaced by **the least element** of the set (and there are well-ordered sets that are bigger and more complicated than we can possibly imagine just now). The resulting statement is a very deep and powerful tool called **transfinite induction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfinite induction is an extension of mathematical induction to well-ordered sets, for example to sets of ordinal numbers or cardinal numbers. Proofs or constructions using **induction** and **recursion** often use **the axiom of choice** to produce a well-ordered relation that can be treated by transfinite induction. However, if the relation in question is already well-ordered, one can often use transfinite induction without invoking the axiom of choice.\n",

    "## Exercise 4.5.5 (Goldbach Conjecture):\n",
    "Q: What is the smallest natural number that can be written as a sum of three primes but can't be written as a sum of two primes?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: This is related to the **Goldbach conjecture**. The **weak Goldbach conjecture** states that _any odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes_. This has been proven in 2012. The **strong version** of the conjecture states _every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers_. This remains unsolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it is clear that a number that can be written as the sum of three prime numbers but can't be written as the sum of two prime numbers must be an odd number. And an odd number is the sum of an odd number and an even number. The only even prime number is 2. So, we need to find the smallest odd number k such that k-2 is not a prime number. It turns out that k=11.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4.5.7 (Induction Implies Well-ordering):\n",
    "This is the inverse of **THEOREM 4.4**. Together, it is saying that **well-ordering property** and the **validity of induction** is **equivalent**.\n",

    "This is an example of **telescoping series** which is a series whose partial sums eventually only have a fixed number of terms after cancellation. Notice that $$\\frac{1}{n(n+1)} = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n+1}$$.\n",
