Then the full question was answered in the affirmative by Aleksandr Gelfond in 1934, and refined by Theodor Schneider in 1935. This result is known as **Gelfond's theorem** or the **Gelfond–Schneider theorem**. This immediately proves the transcendence of many numbers such $e^\\pi$ (**Gelfond's constant**), and $i^i$."
