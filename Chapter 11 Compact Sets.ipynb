    "## THEOREM (Extreme Value Theorem)\n",
    "If $f$ is a **continuous function** whose **domain** is a **closed, bounded** interval, then $f$ assumes a **maximum** on its domain. This is equivalent to say for a **continuous function** $f$ and its **closed, bounded** domain $S$, $\\sup f(S) \\in f(S)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By a **bounded function**, we mean that its **range** is bounded. The purpose of the investigation in this chapter is to study what is special about a closed and bounded interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DEFINITION 11.1 (Compact Set):\n",
    "The set $K\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is **compact** if every continuous function $f: K\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ assumes a **maximum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## EXAMPLE 11.1:\n",
    "+ **Closed, bounded intervals** are compact.\n",
    "+ **Finite sets** are compact.\n",
    "+ The **whole real line** is _not_ compact.\n",
    "+ $\\mathbb{N}$ is _not_ compact.\n",
    "+ $H=\\{1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{4}...\\}$ is _not_ compact.\n",

    "The union of any **finite collection** of compact sets is compact.\n",

    "A **compact set** is closed and bounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 11.1.6:\n",
    "+ (a) The union of an infinite collection of compact sets need not be compact. For example, any open set is an (uncoutably) infinite collection of inidividual points, which are compact.\n",
    "+ (b) However, an infinite collection of compact sets could still be compact such as the $S$ in **EXAMPLE 11.1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 11.1.8:\n",
    "The **difference** of two compact sets need not be compact. Such as the $S$ in **EXAMPLE 11.1**, the difference $S\\setminus \\{0\\}=H$. Both $S$ and $\\{0\\}$ are compact but $H$ is not.\n",
    "\n",

    "# The Covering Property\n",
    "**DEFINITION 11.1** is only **partially topological**. The issue of **continuous function** is **topological**. But we must also consider the **nontopological** question of **maximum** which needs the **ordering** of the real line to make sense. The purpose of introducing the concept of **covering property** is to make a completely topological definition of compactness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DEFINITION 11.5 (Open Cover):\n",
    "A collection of **open sets** $\\{U_\\alpha:\\alpha\\in\\mathcal{A}\\}$ is an **open cover** of the set $S$ if $S\\subseteq \\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in\\mathcal{A}}U_\\alpha$. If $\\{U_\\alpha\\}$ is an open cover of $S$, we say that we have **covered** $S$ with $\\{U_\\alpha\\}$.\n",

    "The reason that we made $\\alpha$ as a subscript because we made no commitment as to the **cardinality** of the **index set** $\\mathcal{A}$.\n",

    "A set has the **covering property** if any open cover of it has a **finite subcover**.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Exercise 11.2.4 (Non-compact Sets don't have Covering Property):\n",
    "If the set is not compact, there is a continuous function $f$ defined on it that attains no maximum. Hence, if $f(x)$ is any value of $f$, there is a number $y$ in the set with $f(y)>f(x)$. So, we can always construct an open cover of this set with no finite subcover.\n",
