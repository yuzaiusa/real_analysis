    "## DEFINITION 9.1 (Real Sequence):\n",
    "A real sequence is a function . Real here refers to the range of the function. We should distinguish the sequence  in which the order is important from the range  which is a set and doesn’t have order by itself.\n",

    "# Convergence\n",
    "## DEFINITION 9.2 (Convergence and Limit):\n",
    "+ (a) A sequence  is said to converge to L if, for every ε > 0, there is a number  so that . If this is the case, we say L is the limit of  and write . (This is usually called the \"ε-N version\" of the definition.) \n",
    "+ (b) A sequence  is said to converge if there is a number L so that  converges to L. A sequence that does not converge is said to diverge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that L must be a number. A sequence cannot converge to .\n",
    "Also, it is reasonable to assume  depends on ε. If we make our “error tolerance” smaller, we expect to be required go further along in the process to achieve it.\n",

    "\n",
    "## FINAL DEFINITION 9.5 (Convergence):\n",
    "The sequence  converges to L if it is eventually in any neighborhood of L.\n",
    "The deep part of the theory of convergent sequences can be stated as “if the terms in a sequence get close to a limit, they must get close to each other”. This is what behind Cauchy convergence.\n",

    "It is worth noting that the proof of this theorem depends on the result of Exercise 4.10.4, which states \"If x ≠ y , show that there are neighborhoods U of x and V of y such that “. This is not true in every topological space. It depends very much on the separation property of the topological space. A space with this property is called a Hausdorff space.

If the field is not Archimedean, 1/n does not converge to 0.
