    "# An Approximation Problem\n",
    "## DEFINITION 9.1 (Real Sequence):\n",
    "A **real sequence** is a function $x : N \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. **Real** here refers to the **range** of the function. We should distinguish the **sequence** $(x_n)$ in which the **order** is important from the **range** $\\{x_n\\}$ which is a **set** and doesn’t have order by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convergence\n",
    "## DEFINITION 9.2 (Convergence and Limit):\n",
    "+ (a) A sequence $(x_n)$ is said to **converge** to $L$ if, for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there is a number $N_\\epsilon$ so that $|x_n - L| < \\epsilon$ whenever $n > N_\\epsilon$. If this is the case, we say $L$ is the **limit** of $(x_n)$ and write $\\lim x_n = L$. (This is usually called the **\"$\\epsilon$-$N$ version\" of the definition**.) \n",
    "+ (b) A sequence $(x_n)$ is said to **converge** if there is a number $L$ so that $(x_n)$ converges to $L$. A sequence that does not converge is said to **diverge**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $L$ must be a number. A sequence cannot converge to $\\infty$.\n",
    "Also, it is reasonable to assume $N_\\epsilon$ depends on $\\epsilon$. If we make our “_error tolerance_” smaller, we expect to be required go further along in the process to achieve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ALTERNATE DEFINITION 9.3 (Convergence and Limit):\n",
    "$(x_n)$ **converges** to $L$ if, for each neighborhood $V$ of $L$, there is a number $N_V$ so that $x_n \\in V$ whenever $n>N_V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DEFINITION 9.4 (Eventually and Frequently): \n",
    "+ (a) A sequence $(x_n)$ is **eventually** in the set $S$ if there is a number $N$ so that $x_n \\in S$ whenever $n>N$. \n",
    "+ (b) A sequence $(x_n)$ is **frequently** in a set $S$ if for any natural number $N$, there is an $n > N$ for which $x_n\\in S$.\n",

    "The sequence $(x_n)$ **converges** to $L$ if it is **eventually** in **any neighborhood** of $L$.\n",

    "The deep part of the **theory of convergent sequences** can be stated as “_if the terms in a sequence get close to a limit, they must get close to each other_”. This is what behind **Cauchy convergence**.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Exercise 9.2.8:\n",
    "If there is an $\\epsilon > 0$ so that $(x_n)$ is **not eventually** in any interval of length $\\epsilon$, then $(x_n)$ **divergences**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 9.2.9 (Limit of a sequence and the limit of its rolling average):\n",
    "Given a sequence of $(x_n)$, define a sequence $(a_n)$ by $$a_n = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n}$$. If $\\lim x_n = L$, then $\\lim a_n = L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of above is not true. It is possible that $(a_n)$ converges to $L$ but $(x_n)$ diverges. An example would be $(x_n)$ is the sum of a convergent sequence $(y_n)$ and an error term of alternating $+1$ and $-1$, i.e. $x_n=y_n + (-1)^n$. The arithmetic average of the error term converges to zero. So $(a_n)$ converges to the limit of $(y_n)$. But $(x_n)$ does not converge.\n",

    "# Convergent Sequences\n",
    "## THEOREM 9.6 (Uniqueness of the limit of a sequence and bounded sequences):\n",
    "A sequence can have **at most one limit**. We say a seqeunce $(x_n)$ is **bounded** if its **range** $\\{x_n\\}$ is a **bounded set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that the proof of this theorem depends on the result of **Exercise 4.10.4**, which states \"If $x \\ne y$ , there are neighborhoods $U$ of $x$ and $V$ of $y$ such that $U\\cap V=\\emptyset$“. This is _not_ true in all **topological spaces**. It depends very much on the **separation property** of the topological space. A space with this property is called a **Hausdorff space**.
