    "# The Integer Part of a Number: The Archimedean Property\n",
    "## THEOREM 6.1 (Archimedean Property):\n",
    "Let $(F, P)$ be an **ordered field** having the **Least Upper Bound property**, and let $x$ be any element of $F$. Then there is a natural number $n_x$ with $n_x>x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means **Least Upper Bound property implies Archimedean Property**. The completeness of real numbers is actually about two different things. One is that there should be \"**no missing point**\", or \"**no gap**\" according to Dedekind's terminology, in the real line. All six theorems in the BIG THEOREM can achieve this goal. Another point is that there should **NOT be \"too many\" points**. In such cases of large non-Archimedean fields, real numbers could be isomorphic to a subfield or that ordered field, but not the whole. This property is guaranteed by the **Archimedean property**.  Not all theorems listed in the BIG THEOREM implies the Archimedean property. We group the theorems into two groups. The **Least Upper Bound** (also called the **Dedekind complete property**), the **Heine-Borel theorem**, the **connectedness property**, and the **Dedekind Cut property** listed in Chapter 22, implies the Archimedean property. On the other hand, the **Nested Intervals property**, the **Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem** and the **Cauchy Complete property**, do not imply the Archimedean property. This is actually a statement that the **Cauchy completeness is weaker than the Dedekind completeness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**THEOREM 6.1** states that an ordered field with Least Upper Bound property is Archimedean. However, for ordered fields that Least Upper Bound property is not held, such as rational numbers, it is still possible to be Archimedean.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **non-Archimedean ordered field** contains numbers that are greater than any natural number, i.e. **infinity**, and therefore **infinitesimals**. The existence of infinitesimals implies existence of infinity. When an ordered field is not Archimedean, one importance property does not hold, i.e. $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\neq 0$. This means that $\\inf \\frac{1}{n}$ is the infinitesimal rather than zero because zero is a lower bound but not the largest lower bound. An example of non-Archimedean field is the **formal rational functions field**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 7.6.5** shows that **Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem** fails in any non-Archimedean ordered field. However, an extended version of \"$\\kappa$-Bolzano-Weierstrass\" may hold in certain very large non-Archimedean fields. See _Real analysis in reverse_ to find such an example.\n",
