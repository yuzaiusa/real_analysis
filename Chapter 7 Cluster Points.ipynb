    "Knowing that a set is infinite would seem to be more useful than knowing just that it is not empty. Curiously, it is often easier to show that a set is infinite than to show that it is not empty. It is rare that the more useful bit of information is easier to come by.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the definition of cluster point depends on intervals, which in turn depends on the definition of **distance**, or a **metric space**. In a more general view of **topological spaces**, this will be replaced by **open sets**.\n",

    "+ (2) If $S$ is **neighborhood** of $s$, then $s$ is a cluster point of $S$. However, if $s$ is a cluster point of $S$, $S$ is _NOT_ necessary a neighborhood of $s$ (for example the end point of a closed interval).

    "+ (2) The derived set of an infinite set can be finite or empty.\n",
    "+ (3) $\\mathbb{Q}’=\\mathbb{R}$. That means the derived set  can be much larger than the set itself. Here the derived set of a **countable set** is **uncountable**. Along this line, $(\\mathbb{R}\\setminus \\mathbb{Q})’ = \\mathbb{R}$. Two different sets may have the same derived sets. There are **no antiderivatives**.\n",

    "Adding **finitely many points** to a set or deleting finitely many points from a set does not change its derived set.\n",

    "+ (e) A set can have **at most countably many** isolated points. This is because any discrete subset $S$ of Euclidean space must be countable, since the isolation of each of its points together with the fact the rationals are dense in the reals means that the points of $S$ may be mapped into a set of points with rational coordinates, (i.e. open intervals with rational endpoints) of which there are only countably many. However, **not every countable set** is discrete, of which the rational numbers under the usual Euclidean metric are the canonical example (none of the rational numbers is an isolated point).\n",
